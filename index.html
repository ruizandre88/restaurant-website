     <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>A Queen Anne neighborhood fixture since 1962, Delicious Eats Diner serves classic American comfort food with a modern twist. Our vintage chrome and vinyl booths set the scene for innovative dishes that honor traditional diner culture while embracing contemporary flavors.</p>
            <p>Under Chef Kai's leadership, we craft beloved classics using locally sourced, seasonal ingredients from our Pacific Northwest neighbors. From our signature cheeseburger to house-made clam chowder, each dish balances comfort with quality. Our menu features both traditional favorites and creative plant-based options, ensuring there's something for everyone.</p>
            <p>More than just a restaurant, we're a community gathering place where good food meets warm hospitality. Stop by for a vanilla milkshake, bring friends for dinner, or treat yourself to a slice of our famous key lime pie â€“ there's always a seat waiting for you at Delicious Eats.</p>
